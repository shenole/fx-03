Demo experiment using Foundation

The purpose of this project is to create a homepage modeled after a randomly chosen webpage design from Google Images, using the keyword "website design" in the search.

Tools will include:

HTML5
CSS3
Javascript
JQuery
SASS
Foundation
Git/Github
Adobe Photoshop
Atom (text editor)

The homepage links will NOT lead to new destinations, but any other functionality appropriate for the homepage... transitions, animations, onClick actions, etc. will be present.

Note - The homepage will be BASED off of the randomly selected design, and NOT and exact duplicate, as a link to the model page is not available and so it is impossible to obtain the exact images or fonts used.
