Demo experiment using Foundation

The purpose of this project is to create a homepage modeled after a randomly chosen webpage design from Google Images, using the keyword "website design" in the search.

Tools will include:

HTML5
CSS3
SASS
Foundation
Git/Github
Adobe-Photoshop
Atom (text editor)

The homepage links will NOT lead to new destinations.

Note - The homepage will be BASED off of the randomly selected design, and will NOT and exact duplicate, as a link to the model page is not available and so it is impossible to obtain the exact images, measurements, or fonts used.
